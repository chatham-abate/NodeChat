# NodeChat
A web based messaging platform intended for quick and convient conversations within a small network. __NodeChat__ uses Node.js with Express to run its backend server and React.js to run its client.

Try the [demo](https://nodechatclientdemo.herokuapp.com/)!

__Note__ the demo is hosted by Heroku, so the server may be asleep currently. This may cause the webpage to load somewhat slowly.
